<h1>Participant Code Narratives</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Sreve and I work at the University of Pittsburgh. I have always been scared of code...mainly, I think, because I lacked exposure to it. While I did use a little HTML when I ran my own business, in my teaching and practice I have relied on visual design web tools like Adobe Muse, Webflow, and drag-n-drop tools like Mobirise, Wix, and Weebly. But at some point I realized that the more I work with and these tools, the more I am at the mercy of corporations and their code. As a result, I have been working to develop tools and pedagogies to help introduce educators and students to code, computer science, and open-source collaboration.</p>

Need to see some project samples before thinking up your own? Check out student projects on <a href="http://www.tcrg.pitt.edu">Pitt's TCRG</a>

  <p>Hello! I'm Steve and I'm proposing we work together on a project called <a href="https://open-fuego.github.io/Open-Fuego-Coding-Tools/">Open Fuego</a>. Open Fuego is a suite of coding tools that you can fork and customize for your institution and its specific needs. This tool will introduce code literacy, computational thinking, and computer science knowledge to your students. Our pilot study data say that students who use Pitt Fuego develop the skills and confidence needed to learn more about coding. We look forward to your contributions.
